            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>   Hello(World) I'm Sarju Thakkar. I'm 16 years old and attend Normandy High School as a Junior. I love making and programming different projects in a variety of languages. I use Swift, Java, Python, and Arduino to create fun and useful products for everyday life. I have made a few apps and games for both Android and iOS, some of which are published on the Google Play Store. I've been building for 5 years now and have progressed from using simple circuits to programming robots. Because you read through all of this I'd just like to say..........(click on the ! after welcome on the homepage). </p>
